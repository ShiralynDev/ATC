This panel is made in C++ and shows the ATC panel with all interactive buttons, showing all data sent to/from the server aswell as allowing you to change stuff like speed, brake pressure and send balise information. This is only recommended to be used for debugging of the ATC_Dator, this will most likley interfere with the data of another client.
